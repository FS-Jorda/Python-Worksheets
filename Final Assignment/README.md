Welcome to the Final Programming Assignment for the term. It is due Friday, December 11.

**IMPORTANT: We have intentionally started with pretty simple examples to push you to explore a bit on your own. Using Google to help you find (say) Python Reddit examples is a good tool. If you are having trouble finding examples of something that you need to do, reach out to Ellie and Dr. Lepinski. We are happy to provide additional examples, but we also want you to explore a bit on your own**

Below we outline the four options for the final assignment. Each of these options is designed to be somewhat open-ended, but each option, we attempt to provide you with some concrete first steps. You will need to explore some new material on your own to complete these projects, but we are here to help. Don't hesitate to post on Piazza or email Ellie and Dr. Lepinski if you need help.

**OPTION ONE: ANIMALS WITH JOBS** 

**Overview:** Reddit provides a very nice interface for grabbing posts from a particular subreddit. Two of our favorite subreddits are /r/catswithjobs and /r/turtleswithjobs. For this project, you will explore the kinds of jobs that Turtles and Cats have by processing information from these subreddits. 

**Goals:**
You are encouraged to be creative, but here are some ideas for that you might do for this project. 
Note: That doing any one of these well is sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the assignment, but you are strongly encouraged to push yourself and do more than the minimum.

* Find the recent cat job with the most upvotes. Then go and see what turtles have similar jobs. (For example, what turtle jobs share similar keywords in the text)
* Find the keywords that appear most often in turtle jobs and cat jobs. What words are commonm among cat jobs but rare among turtle jobs (or vice versa). Alernatively, instead of looking at the most frequently appearing keywords, you could look at what keywords are appear in highly upvoted posts in the two forums.
* Look at the comments that people make in cat jobs and in turtle jobs. Are there differences in the way that people respond to cat jobs as compared to turtle jobs? For example, are people more likely to think that a cat is "cute" as compared to a "turtle"? (It would be sad if that were true, but it would be good to know)

**First Steps:**
To get started, we recommend that you do the following. 

* Look at the reddit Python notebook in this github repository : https://github.com/mlepinski/Python-Worksheets/blob/master/Reddit/Reddit_examples.ipynb
* Look at the documentation for PRAW (the Python Reddit package) here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Experiment PRAW to do some simple tasks like grabbing a recent /r/catswithjobs post and printing out the title text and the amount of upvotes

**OPTION TWO: FUN WITH GRAPHICS**

**Overview:** Google Collab doesn't provide graphics capabilities, but if you download Python onto your machine you can make colorful shapes move around the screen. You could even create a simple game. 

**Goals:**
You are encouraged to be creative, but here are some ideas for that you might do for this project. 
Note: That doing any one of these well is sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the assignment, but you are strongly encouraged to push yourself and do more than the minimum.

* Make several circles and have them move around the screen and bounce off the walls and each other. 
* Make a simple game where there is a cluster of stationary circles and the player sends a new circle flying into the cluster of stationary circles to collide with them and send them all flying around the screen. (This idea is inspired by the start of a pool game. You could optionally put pockets in the four corners and give the player points if any of the bouncing circles reached the pockets.)
* Make a simple game where the player uses the keyboard to control a paddle (a rectangle) and then tries to catch a bouncing ball repeatedly on the paddle to prevent it from hitting the bottom of the screen. 

**First Steps:**
To get started, we recommend that you do the following. 

* Download Python onto your machine 
* Download the graphics.py package from this Dr. Zelle's webiste: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
* Look at the graphics examples in this github repository : https://github.com/mlepinski/Python-Worksheets/tree/master/Graphics
* Look at the documentation for the graphics package: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
* Try to get a single circle to move around the screen and bounce when it hits the edges of the screen.

**OPTION THREE: CONCERNING COVID**

**Overview:** Fivethirtyeight has some great data on American's responses to polls throughout 2020 which asked people how concerned they were about Covid. We can use a python library with graph and plot tools to visualize this data. 

**Goals:**
You are encouraged to be creative, but here are some ideas for that you might do for this project. 
Note: That doing any one of these well is sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the assignment, but you are strongly encouraged to push yourself and do more than the minimum.

* Make several nice (visually polished) graphs showing how people's concern about Covid has evolved over time. It would be great if you could call attention to features in the graphs that you find interesting. Think about what visual options would best help the user to understand the data. Perhaps you want several snapshot bar graphs at various key points in time, perhaps you can come up with something better. Also, keep in mind that averaging polls that taken around the same time may provide a better sense of what is happening than any single poll. 
* Find a CSV file online that has data about Covid cases (or deaths) over time. Graph this new data that you have found along with the survey data. Help the viewer understand the extent to which actual cases (or deaths) are driving Americans' concern about Covid. 

**First Steps:**
To get started, we recommend that you do the following. 

* Look at the CSV files for polling data in this github repository : https://github.com/mlepinski/Python-Worksheets/tree/master/Matplotlib/Data
* Look at the matplotlib Python notebook in this github repository : https://github.com/mlepinski/Python-Worksheets/tree/master/Matplotlib
* Look at the official matplotlib documentation:  https://matplotlib.org/
* Experiment with matplotlib to do some simple tasks like taking a single column from the actual data and displaying it on a plot.

**OPTION FOUR: NONE OF THE ABOVE**

**Overview:** We brainstormed and came up with three ideas above. Howeve, you are awesome and creative, maybe you have come up with a great idea that we hadn't thought of. You can do something different and exciting for the final project as long as you get it approved by Ellie and Dr. Lepinski. (Just send us your idea, we are very happy to work with you to help turn your idea into something that would work well for the final assignment.)

**Goals:**
Whatever you want your goal to be. You should challenge yourself, but also make sure it is modest enough that you can reasonably finish in the next three weeks. We are here to help you come up with something reasonable, just send us your idea. 

**First Steps:**
We are very happy to point you towards useful resources and suggest first steps once we have figured out what your goals are.
